Chapter 8 of the textbook essentailly just told me what README
files are, and what they do, and how to make them look fancy. Out of everything to retain
from this chapter for later use, is how to mess with the text inside the file to make it look different, 
like diffrerent numbered headings and lists. In Chatper 9, it showed me basic project implementation into github. Everything in this chapter was very useful, especially to a beginner, but out of everything to retain from this chapter, 
what I would like to retain is how to link my repo to my local repo. This is very useful and at this point at the end of the chapter, it feels like I could do all these steps with my eyes close, but linking is still something I need to look at every now and then.
