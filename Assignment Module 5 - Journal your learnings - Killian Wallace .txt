Chapters that I remember vividly reading and using throughout the last
two modules are chapter 7-12. Chapter 7 showed how to set up Git,
and the basics needed if you were to set up a server. I am only ever so far
at least, going to use Git in assosiation with Github. But we'll see where I stand
on that in the future. Chapter 8 and 9 showed READMEs and basic project implementation, as said in the 
previous journal. Chapter 10 introduced me to issues, which is 
where were getting into the territory of Git that I haven't quite delved into yet.
I find issues very interesting and useful though, and I'm exctied to see how
they're used in a proffessional project enviorment. Chapter 11
introduced me to branches, pull requests, and basic merging and file
managing working in a team enviorment. It is nice to see all of these because
I'm starting to be able to see myself in this kind of enviorment of merging branches and fixing
merging conflicts often. Finally, Chapter 12 delved deeper into pull requests, and also
showing me how code reviews are done! This is the first time
I've ever done a successful code review in action, even if its only myself.
