I am writing my journal on a .txt document on my computer. In chapter one, it was mostly just a run down of git, how it works, and why it is used.
Out of everything in chapter one, I just want to retain general knowledge on the usability of git. In chapter two, we are shown how to install and set up git.
I did not end up doing this from the textbook, but the useful knowledge for me to retain here is how to set my global config to change my username and email, 
which I actually used during one of the assignents! In chapter three, we are shown the basics of git, like status, how to initalize, and general getting used to it. 
Its hard to say what was the most helpful, but probably git status and git commit, as they most useful thing from this chapter that I am using somewhat constantly.
In chapter four, it is mainly focusing on .gitignores and how to ignore certain files. It also shows us how to view old version/changes of the project. 
Both of these are so very useful! But it introducing me to the .gitignores was huge, as I wasn't really sure what that was even though I saw it in almost every repo I went to.
Being able to check the old versions is also nice, esepcially for security. In chapter 5, we are shown how to checkout to a old version and come back, as well as amend 
and mess with previous commits. The checkout feature is really interesting and I bet, escpailly for games and software, it is really fun to mess around with.
I am a bit of a goofball though, and alot of times accidentally commit or do things I don't mean to, which this chapter shows alot of solutions for.
