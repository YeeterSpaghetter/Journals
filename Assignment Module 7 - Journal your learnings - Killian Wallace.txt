We went over chapters 15 and 16 in our textbook.
Chapter 15 was all about the various tools you can use as a visualization for git.
It started off with simply git gui, then gitk, and then showed VSCode, Github desktop, and other 
various tools. Out of all of them, I'm going to take away most git gui, and gitk, because they are git features
that are very useful and they are straight from the terminal, and easy to use. Everything else that was brought up
I have already researched for my own purposes, or other assignemnts. Chapter 16 was about the more
advanced commands of git, like reverting, stashing, and resetting. Out of all of these, reverting and resetting
seemn both helpful, reset more because I've had to actually use that already when I've messed up a push or commit.
Reverting seems situationally helpfuly, but stashing just seems like reverting, but you're throwing it somewhere it
"might" get used later, it's like a garbage disposal for ideas.
