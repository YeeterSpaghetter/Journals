In chapter 13, it introduced me to basic conflict fixing and merging inside of Git and Github. Some certain aspects I will remember are in general things about commits but one thing
I like was it telling me the colors of which is a remote and which is a local in the terminal. This chapter also certain just made me more comfortable with creatings new branches,
working on them, merging them together with other branches as well as pulling them, and deleteing. Chapter 14 was about dealing with the aftermath of a merge with a conflict. It
shows how to push that change and view the diff between branches. I usually use software like VSCODE, which already makes it easy to see changes, but its still nice to see it in
the terminal.
